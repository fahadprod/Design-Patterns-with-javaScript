    <h1>Composite Pattern</h1>
    <p><mark>Get output by console</mark></p>
    <p>This is a structural design pattern that composes objects into tree-like structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. In this pattern, each node in the tree-like structure can be either an individual object 
        or a composed collection of objects. Regardless, each node is treated uniformly.</p>
