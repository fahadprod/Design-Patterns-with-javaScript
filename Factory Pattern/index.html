    <h1>Factory Pattern</h1>
    <p><mark>Get output in console</mark></p>
    <p>Factory pattern is another class-based creational pattern. In this, we provide a generic interface that delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.
        This pattern is frequently used when we need to manage or manipulate collections of objects that are different yet have many similar characteristics.</p>
