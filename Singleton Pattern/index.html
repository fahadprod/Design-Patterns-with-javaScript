    <h1>Singleton Pattern</h1>
    <p><mark>Get output in console</mark></p>
    <p>Singleton is a special creational design pattern in which only one instance of a class can exist. It works like this â€” if no instance of the singleton class exists then a new instance is created and returned, but if an instance already exists, then the reference to the existing instance is returned.
        A perfect real-life example would be that of mongoose (the famous Node.js ODM library for MongoDB). It utilizes the singleton pattern.</p>
